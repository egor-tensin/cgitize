cgitize
=======

[![CI](https://github.com/egor-tensin/cgitize/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/egor-tensin/cgitize/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Self-host your repositories using cgit.

Supports cloning all of your repositories from major hosting providers:

* GitHub,
* Bitbucket,
* GitLab.

Example output can be found at https://git.tensin.name/.

Installation
------------

    pip install cgitize

Usage
-----

Pass the path to the config to `cgitize` (/etc/cgitize/cgitize.toml by
default):

    cgitize --config path/to/cgitize.toml

See an example config file at [examples/cgitize.toml].

cgitize uses the `git` executable, which might use `ssh` internally.
Make sure the required keys are loaded to a ssh-agent (or, _preferably_, use
access tokens/application passwords).
